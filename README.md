## TODOs:
- Override default game configs as per input.txt. Initialise game after that.
- Add logic to override dice value and give a value manually
- Add behaviour specific tests = if snake bike, if ladder climb, if existing player at target position
- Add logic to have different strategies invoked for player movement as per number of dice rolled and values.
- Update input parser to take manual dice values if given [any input format is fine]

------
